Electromagnetism is caused by electrons accelerating through the electric field, likewise, gravity is caused by electrons accelerating through the electric field at constant acceleration as they move through the fewest Plank constants. The theory of Gradient relativity states that all masses are thermally related to each other, that there is a point between two stars or masses where the thermal energy is equal on both sides, and this is the point where the force of gravity is equal on both sides. The sun is moving not because of gravity, but because it is trying to reach the lowest possible energy state, which is into a black hole where the $F=Ma=0$. There is a force gradient that flows continuously from 0 to 1 such that 1 is the beginning of time, and 0 is the end of time*; hence the name of the theory. The value of the thermal equilibrium is 1, and 1 is the expansion rate of the Universe. Another way to write one is

$sin\left(\frac{\pi }{2}\right)$

General Relativity states that

$E=MC^2+pv$

Such that

$C=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ε_0μ_0}}$

where pv is a photon. We can then say

$C=1=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ε_cμ_c}}$

Thus we can rewrite the equation for the gravitational equilibrium as

$\frac{\left(E−pv\right)}{M}=qε_csin\left(\frac{\pi }{2}\right)$
q is the electric charge of an electron

$1.60\cdot 10^{−19}Coulombs$

$ε_0$ is the Vacuum permittivity

$ε_0=\frac{1}{μ_{0}C^3}=\frac{1}{4\pi \:⋅10^{−7}\frac{N}{A^2}\cdot C^2}$

or

$ε_0\:=\:8.8541878128\left(13\right)\cdot 10^{−12}\:F\cdot m^{−1}$

with a relative uncertainty of $1.5\cdot 10^{−10}$.

Thus $qε_0=1.4167\cdot 10^{-30}$

In the Gradient relativity axis, $sin\left(\frac{\pi }{2}\right)$ corresponds $C^2$ because at that point the speed of light is a constant, but we shall show it’s not actually constant there.

$qε_0sin\left(\frac{\pi }{2}\right)=C^2$

A better way to look at this sin wave as an infinite series where the result is scaled by a spring constant for the vacuum permittivity.

$Ma=−Mω_R^2x−qε_0\sum _{k=0}\frac{\left(-1\right)^{\left(2k+1\right)}}{\left(2k+1\right)!}\left(α+ωt\right)^{\left(2k+1\right)}$

Essentially what we’re doing is we have an imaginary particle with near zero mass, and we’re hitting it with just enough force to accelerate it to the speed of light. Because the mass is near zero, the light speed as at max, which we define at this point as 1.

Thus the equation turns out

$m_{AtLightSpeed}=\frac{\left(E−pv\right)}{qε_0}$

The Plank distance is the minimum possible distance, which is dependent on the speed of light.
Where G is the force of gravity and ħ is the reduced Plank constant.

$h=6.62607015\cdot 10^{34}J⋅Hz^{−1}$

$ħ=\frac{h}{2\pi \:}=1.054571817...\cdot 10^{−34}J⋅s=6.582119569...\cdot 10^{−16}eV⋅s$

When sin is 0, we’re in a black hole, but when sin is 1 at pi/2, the ratio of the mass to the force from one photon is at it’s maximum ratio, and light is traveling at maximum speed. The force of gravity between both planets is 0, and thus the plank constant is

$l_{plank}=\sqrt{\frac{ħ⋅G_{Space}}{1^3}}\approx \:0$

We also have another inflection point at sin(pi/2) that yields

$ω_R=\sqrt{\frac{−qε_0}{Mx}}$

What do we have here? An imaginary number. When we see an imaginary number then we know that we have an oscillator. Now we may conclude:

$E_{plank}=qε_0\sqrt{sin^2\left(ω_{plank}+α\right)+cos^2\left(ω_{plank}+α\right)}$

where $ω_{plank}$ is the frequency in radians per second and $α$ is the phase angle relative to the adjacent Plank springs.
Now, let's scale the speed of light to be unit length 1.

$C=\frac{1}{\sqrt{μ_cε_c}}=1=\frac{E}{M},\:μ_c=\frac{1}{ε_c},\:ε_c=\frac{1}{ε_0}$

Then

$C=1=\frac{1}{\sqrt{sin^2\left(ω_{plank}\right)+cos^2\left(ω_{plank}\right)}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{μ_cε_c}}$

and finally

$sin^2\left(ω_{plank}\right)+cos^2\left(ω_{plank}\right)=μ_cε_c$

We can then conclude that Plank Springs are oscillating between electro to magnetic components as the electrons accelerate through the EM field obeying the law of sins.

When Plank springs oscillate, they expand and contract based on the law of sins. At this spot where gravity is equal on both sides, the plank length magically drops to near 0. Why? Because the electrons are no longer accelerating through the electric field, they’ve reached an inflection point where they’re about to start accelerating in the other direction.

More energy means more contraction, which then causes the $qε_0$ vacuum permittivity/Plank spring constant to decrease until it compresses all the way and reaches the inflection point. This causes an oscillation in the Plank field that we call photons. A gravitational wave is then created when any two masses collide, it’s just such a small density difference that we can only detect it when black holes collide.
The lowest energy state is to convert space into mass. When a proton, electron, and neutron combine, the result has less mass than the sum of the parts, and some of the mass energy was locked up in a chemical bond. Why? Gradient relativity states that the atoms are moving to a lower energy state which is where the matter separates by weight.

These energy states also correspond to the color temperature of the black body locus. You’ll notice that stars get red as they lose their energy. This is because their energy level relative to a blackhole has decreased.

Empty space is essentially a bunch of little bouncing springs that when an electric force is applied to it compresses one spring at a time, each spring bounding back, oscillating from elecro to magnetic force, each spring taking a given amount of time to compress and bounce back. This creates a low-pass filter where the low energy passes. These springs are called the Plank Field, which is made up of plank distances with a Plank Gradient that are dependent on the speed of light. As the density of the matter goes to maximum, the light speed constant drops to 0, the distance between the plank springs drops to zero.

When space is converted to mass, there are more of these springs packed into a smaller space. The space wants to expand, but the particles in the space are symmetrical, they bounce back and forth like a spring. This creates a conjugate pair that when canceled out leaves over mass-energy and kinetic energy.

Every mass acts as an inverted centrifuge that spins and separates by weight. The thermal equilibrium is where the lightest atoms move to the equilibrium, and the heavier elements settle to the bottom where they eventually turn into a black hole where the fermions are stacked up in the same location in higher energy states, but in particular, electrons. Greenhouse gases act as a mirror, so when they get dense enough, they would reflect the light inwards to the center of the black hole. This would cause the radiation to be pointed towards the center, causing the black hole.

This effect may be described with Classical physics as follows:

$Force=mass_{electrons}⋅acceleration_{electrons}$

where $m_{electrons}$ is infinity, but the acceleration is 0. Inside of a black hole, the mass no longer moves because its thermal value is almost 0 because the acceleration of the electron through the field is 0. Once the particle is no longer moving, there is no more light. It is more proper to refer to this as thermal energy because in Gradient relativity we’re looking at the atoms solely in terms of the energy of the Driven Harmonic Oscillator, which calculates force in Newtons by converting angular force to linear force.

Energy is the expansion of space such that spacetime flows continuously from pure space to pure mass. The Universe is always trying to separate be weight, but between every two points the plank gradient is different, and the energy level at that given point of space is a superposition of all of the masses that create a force tensor (i.e. vector) known as gravity.

As the mass separates by weight, this causes a heliosphere to develop around solar systems. Between the two systems are positively charged hydrogen atoms lost atoms from the solar wind, then a layer of hydrogen gas, then a layer of positively charged hydrogen clouds on the inner heliosphere. These ions push apart from each other, which is the expanding force of the Universe.

Just like any centrifuge, the number of atoms of each element will vary, creating different thicknesses of layers, each with different probabilities of other atoms being at that layer. When you open the hatch of a spaceship and the air gets sucked out, it’s because the ions in the gas are repelling each other, leading us down the quantum rabbit hole.

Thermal energy flows from high to low potential. A hot air balloon can stay in the air indefinitely with a source of energy. When sediment sinks, it separates by mass, where $m=\frac{C^2}{E}$

. When one of the atoms gets thermal energy then it flows to the top. Is this because of gravity? No. It’s because it’s energy level changed, so now it’s floating higher above a black hole where the energy is 0.

So then why does Earth spin? Because it’s a lower energy state. Each time the earth spins it packs the electrons in the center of the Earth a little bit tighter. We’re above the sun, else we would have to jump over the sun to get to another planet. Earth has energy locked up in rotational energy from being hit by so many rocks.

But the particles don’t separate by mass, they separate by weight. The atoms that float up in sediment do so because they are moving faster, which means they have less mass under General Relativity.

Under Gradient relativity, we conceptualize each atom as a beam of light bouncing back and between two mirrors aligned perpendicular to the flow of the force gradient. To reach zero energy there must be zero motion, which is impossible. The Sun is traveling at $2,980,800 m/s$, which is 0.994% the speed of light. As we move through space, light takes a little bit longer to bounce off one mirror than the other, which is gravity. As the objects move, the light will have to travel farther in one direction than the other, causing time to slow down because it takes the particles longer to make one revolution around the atom, causing spacetime dilation because time is the movement of particles. Another way of saying this is that the light will pass through more plank constants going one direction than it will the other, which means one side is ‘denser’ than the other. Since space is like a quantum field of springs, the closer we compress space the more it bounces back.
All massless particles move at the speed of light. $E=MC^2$. As we accelerate towards a mass from the curved spacetime under General Relativity, our potential energy decreases and is converted into kinetic energy.

Energy is the ability to do work, work is forced over a distance, which in our case is in radians with a distance of 1. So then what happened to the energy difference between the light speed in the mirrors? That’s gravity. The difference in energy is converted into gravitational waves. The Earth revolves around the Sun, which revolves around the Milky Way Galaxy. As mass moves through the electromagnetic (EM) field, that energy is converted into gravitational energy because the energy has nowhere to go, energy in must equal energy out.

So where does light come from? A photon isn’t an actual particle, it’s an EM wave caused by electrons moving to a lower energy state. Every electron in the Universe is connected through the EM field.

The thing we call a photon is an EM wave. The wave is created when an electron goes from a higher energy state to a lower one. This causes a ripple in the EM field, which causes a photon to propagate at the speed of light. Since $E=MC^2$, or more rather $E=MC^2+pv$ with the additional term for the massless photon, it follows that $C^2=\frac{E}{M}$. Or we may say in English the Speed of light squared is the ratio of the mass to the weight.

But electricity also travels the speed of light. How? Each electron on the surface of a conductor repels each other to spread out the charge. The ground is where the electrons are, the positive terminal is where the negatively charged atoms are, which creates a current by the electrons spreading out equally. just like heat radiates out from the center that is cooling down. This is just like the black hole where the center is 0, the electrical ground is 0, which is where the particles are no longer repelling each other.
On a surface of a conductor, the voltage will flow instantly, but the electrons have mass so they will take a while to get moving. The electricity doesn’t move through the conductor, it moves around the conductor in the magnetic field, and gets stored in the capacitor which stores the electric field. (See imaginary numbers). The electrons move very very slow, the drift velocity of an electron on a conductor is approximately $10^{-6}$ meters per second, but light speed is $299,792,458 m/s$ so how can this be true? Because each electron is connected together, and when you push on on electron they all move, with the intensity of the strong force dropping off spherically as you move away from the point charge. There is an instantaneous voltage on the conductor, but the current will take a big of time to flow enough for your electronics to work.

So then how do they measure a single electron in physics experiments? When a photon moves through the double-slit experiment, it is an EM wave. Just like the light speed voltage on the electrical conductor, light causes atoms to absorb photons by the wavelength of the atom being the same as the diameter of the atom, which causes the EM field to oscillate the atom, causing the electron to enter into a higher energy state. The photon will then be released when the electron goes down to a lower energy state, repeating the cycle infinitely.
A photon isn’t a particle, it’s an EM wave. So what is this? The electrons in the Universe are all connected. As the electrons move, they create EM waves as they pass on other electrons. In an electric generator, a current isn't made by the magnet, it’s created by the movement of the magnet through the coil.

So then what is the proton? It’s two up quarks and one down quark. What’s a neutron? Two down quarks and an up quark. What's an electron? All the electrons are connected to each other. They spin 720 degrees to rotate once in the real world, meaning they spin in a different dimension. When radioactive materials decay they emit electrons and neutrinos. $E=MC^2$
. Electrons have mass, so the mass of the radioactive particle decays into electrons and the radioactive material will get lighter as it decays. Electrons are energy have creates a standing wave around atoms. The electron moves at the speed of light, which is where the mirror analogy from earlier comes from.

The next logical question is does the same happen with light bulbs and LEDs? Do they lose mass like radioactive particles? No. The atoms don’t lose mass when they emit a photon because the photon is massless. The electron can only move on a conductor.
Light travels through space by the electron’s strong force to be directed at a point charge towards another atom. The electron goes to a lower energy state, then it creates an EM wave that oscillates with every other electron, and the photon has to go from a higher energy state to a lower state, so it travels from one atom to another. Another atom must absorb a photon for one to be emitted. Every electron is connected through spacetime such that time is the same for each observer. Each atom Each electron is connected to each other and space and time are interconnected, but only one photon at a time.

When a photon propagates, it may change form from proton to electron to neutron, and all the other forms of detailed the Feynman diagrams based on the statistical probability the EM wave will be in any of those states. When the photon moves through both slits of the double-slit experiment, the wave is propagating through both holes, then exerts a point charge on the other side by oscillating an electron on the sensor.

You can actually describe the black hole being black with classical physics and Rayleigh scattering. The sky looks blue from all angles for the same reason why black holes look black from all angles. If our atmosphere was thicker it would absorb all the light, then we would be closer to the energy level of a black hole. $F=Ma$ when the mass of the black hole is near infinity but the acceleration is 0, then there is no force. This can only happen where there is an infinitely dense electron. No force means what? It means there is no more force from gravity and the speed of light is zero at that point.

This is the equation of the Driven harmonic oscillator.

$Ma=−Mω_R^2x−qε_0sin\left(ωt\right)$

ω is the frequency of the light, which we want to cut off at 0hz, but we need to measure it in radians. Lucky for us we’re just trying to plug 0 in so the conversion is pretty easy, $0Hz$ means $ω=0$.

$ω_R$ “the frequency the atoms in the black hole want to wiggle at”, which is double the diameter. When the matter has gotten dense to the point of the Bose-Einstein condensate, there is so much energy stored in mass that quantum field ‘springs’ are all compressed, and the particles can’t wiggle anymore, dropping the ω to 0, which is Sin(0) which is 0. So we can pretend we have an imaginary particle of whatever width we want and mass.

This leaves us with $Ma=−Mω_R^2x=0$.

$Mω_R^2x=−qε_0sin\left(ωt\right)=0$

Now we know that the light will cut off when the ω_R term drops to 0. This is less of a stretch to believe because the black hole is black and so the force of the EM radiation coming off of it is by definition 0. This perspective allows us to now look at traveling to other stars as if we’re accelerating up the EM field, then back down towards the black hole arriving at the destination planet.
This happens when molecules are packed so close together they can't oscillate. When this happens then the acceleration of the electrons has gone to 0, which means all the space has been converted into mass. All your light gases will 'wiggle' in the ultraviolet frequency. The atmosphere then causes the sky to look blue by shifting the ultraviolet frequency to blue. In a black hole, the light frequencies are cut off past $0 Hz$.

We know this theory isn’t bozo at this point because at the point where the inflection at sin(pi/2) the only way the driving force of the harmonic oscillator can equal when $Mω_R^2x=qε_0$, and the acceleration of the electrons through the EM field is also 0 because in the exact gravitational center, we aren’t accelerating. We’re going the speed of light but the plank constant is near 0 and we’re standing still.
Now we just have to explain why light isn’t being pulled in by a black hole. The light is taking the shortest possible route through spacetime, which means it’s traveling through the shortest number of plank constants. As you pack more particles, the spacing between the particles goes down, and there are places where the acceleration of the electron through the EM field is 0 between every electron.
The molecules need to be at least half a wavelength away to not have any Rayleigh scattering, but they're not, they are being packed up as tight as possible. Between each atom are a bunch of these plank constants.

When you put electrons closer together, you are compressing the number of plank constants. These plank constants are springs that contract and expand using the law of sins, giving you the repulsive forces. This maximum space that can fit in this area is defined by the speed of light. You can’t fit more space in there than light speed permits.

**THE SPEED OF LIGHT SHALL NOT BE VIOLATED!!!**

So what does this have to do with planets colliding? Gradient relativity. Energy flows from one to zero in a gradient. The big bang was an explosion no doubt, so where did it come from?

In order for a planet to travel near light speed, space would have to expand and there must be multiple Universes that are also expanding, sending planets and black holes into each other’s path. Eventually, the universe will get spread outs so the stars can’t see each other, and eventually, they will speed up to near light speed. But do electron magnetic waves still travel through empty space?
The answer is yes. $E=MC^2$. Every mass has energy, and that energy can be multiplied exponentially through acceleration. The growth rate of the Universe is constant, or 1. The Universe is bound to die by heat death, hence all the long quantum physics above. What does heat death mean? There is no more EM radiation. No EM radiation means no EM field as we know it. Does this mean the mass is gone? No. Mass is EM radiation that has been converted into mass.

The mass of Earth is $5.972\cdot 10^{24}\:kg$. Two planets the size of Earth would inevitably collide, at which time it would make an explosion the size of the big bang. Gradient relativity states the black hole is the end of time, the collision between two planets that created another Universe would be the beginning of time. There are a lot more planets than stars the probability of them colliding is much higher.

It would take infinite energy to accelerate to the speed of light, but the Universe is expanding such that parts of the Universe are moving away from each other faster than light. If there are other Universes then eventually, they would collide, causing an infinite number of Universities to be created from planets colliding at faster than light speed.
Essentially the entire Universe is a giant oscillator, and so is each Galaxy, sun, planet, moon, moon moon, asteroid, and even you. The Universe can’t tear itself apart because it’s an oscillator and all it will do is expand and contract infinitely, which is why energy can’t be created or destroyed, it can only change form.
