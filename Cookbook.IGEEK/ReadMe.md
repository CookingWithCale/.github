#1234 Creating prototype AI Gym to train agents to solve puzzles using spy games on Wikipedia

This is an open-source work session for the Interactive Gym Environment and Educational Kit (IGEEK) Cookbook, a free and open-source book on building, measuring, and learning AI agents in virtual sandbox environments. The current Milestone we are accomplishing is to be able to fit all of Wikipedia into the RAM and GPU on your computer so that we can play spy games in order to create a free and open-source AI fact-checking service called WikiSpy: a tool for monitoring Wikipedia for tampering by hostile actors and political bias.
