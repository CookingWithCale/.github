I think I have it figured out how to run the #LiveCoding YouTube channel and live streams effectively to help you promote your open-source project and get work done. I can see the pattern in the analytics clear as day: the only videos anyone watched on the KabukiPress Cookbook YouTube channel had "C++ Live Coding" at the start of the title; 0 views on the rest. Any time I have to manage the YouTube channel work grinds to a halt.

We need to make progress on our open-source projects, and also provide more engaging and searchable content. You also can't spend all day managing your YouTube channel. You don't want 6-hour live streams with low progress, that is not worth the silicon or power. You kind of have to run the live stream around getting the work done at all costs, but you require contributors and users.

The Trick is to use OBS optimized for a mobile device because most viewers are on mobile and use OBS's YouTube integration by defining GitHub Milestones for your project to use as your Live Stream template, and try to suck your audience in to help you reach your current milestone. You want to put up a Pomodoro timer on the screen. This can easily be done with an OBS Lua Script. Simply add a hotkey to reset the Pomodoro Timer and just record as many Pomodoro cycles as you can. 

I have a 1080p monitor and I blow it up 2x and use only the upper-right corner of my monitor. A 4K monitor is ideal though.

For example, my current title is  "C++ Live Coding  Milestone 2: Changed ASCII Data Specification to use 64K packed bit pattern ".

For the description, I have right now:

"I'm pomodoro cycling for an open-source project called Serial Chinese Room, Interprocess, and Telemetry Script2 (Script2) that you can contribute to on GitHub and by watching this video. Can you help us reach our next milestone?

To reach this milestone the ASCII Data Types have been updated to the  new 8-bit/16-bit ASCII Data Types. After this milestone, an ASCII List  is used to store a map of type-value tuples, and an ASCII Loom or ASCII  Table is used to store the keys. Please see ASCII Data Specification for  DRY documentation.

You can find this Script2 GitHub milestone at

Make sure when you create your stream with the Management Broadcast button you check the "Remember Settings" box. Each day you want to start your live stream ASAP to get right to work, so you make one thumbnail per Milestone. You do your #LiveCoding stream with the same title each day, and you want to delete that live stream every day so you'll only have one video with that Title. This allows you to reuse the remembered settings in OBS to save time.

The important part is to not have to mess with the OBS or YouTube settings until you complete your Mission. A mission is like an Issue ticket for an Agile development scrum. You record the live stream to a hard drive and end the live stream after you complete a Mission. You will want to stop recording every hour or two and take a break. It's very hard to review long videos, 2 hours is max, shoot for 1 hour 45 minutes with a 15-minute break. The shorter the video the easier it is to scrub through.

YouTube titles are only 100 characters. You will need to select the next Mission you will go on. You then start a new live stream entitled (using my project and current Mission title) "C++ Live Coding Script2 #236 Code Review: Book.Fix Autoject (Auto-Object) SocketFactory..."

Then for the description write "auto-grow code to only copy used memory. Foo" and where I typed Foo you want to add a description of the work that you did (ideally from your GitHub Mission/issue ticket and copy and paste the description from above where I typed Foo only you change:

https://github.com/KabukiStarship/Script2/milestone/2 

to

https://github.com/KabukiStarship/Script2/issues/236

You start off the live stream by showing the users how to find the issue ticket on GitHub. Then you want to then watch the local recordings of you completing the mission, scub through the video and stop when you see anything interesting, adding some commentary. You can also bring on other programmers into your live stream for a code review via Zoom, Skype, RTMP, etc.

After this, you want to do a 25-minute Pomodoro Cycle working on the Mission you pre-selected with a countdown timer on your OBS live stream feed, and end the live stream after one 25-minute cycle so you don't have super long live streams. You now have the option of completing one issue and committing it to GitHub and merging, or if you are not done, you can ask the audience for help finish and point them to other issues they can do. This is your call to action

Once you have accomplished your Milestone, you then do one last live stream with the same Title using the same review format as before.

At this point, you will have sucked people from YouTube into your open-source project and it's a win-win for everyone.
