This live-stream is a Morning cooking session for the KabukiPress Cookbook, an Open-source book that teaches you Modern Embedded-C++, Script2, and IMUL with Kabuki Toolkit. The Session ticket can be found at https://github.com/kabuki-starship/kabuki.press.cookbook/issues/60, and you can find me on the web at https://cookingwithcale.org.

The Green-energy revolution is funded by open-source contributions from people like you.  If you would like to contribute to the book, please fork and star us on GitHub using the Session ticket link above. If you want to help improve Cooking with Cale by funding staff to do stuff like write scripts, make animations, edit cookbooks, advertize, and do AI research, you can become a Patreon at patreon.com/astartup.
