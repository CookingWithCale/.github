In this live-stream, I will teach you how to build an interstellar starship out of a ball of ice enclosed in steel, solar panels, LEDs, a salt heat battery, Oregon-Cooler cold-water gas extraction, and exercise machines to extract gas from the "vacuum" of space, use it for heat energy, and vent the gases out to control the velocity and direction of the spacecraft. Hint: line up the LEVG Drive between the stars.

Minor Correction: We only need 2 tanks to extract the hydrocarbons because we need to feed the light particles to the compost to produce more hydrocarbons; the plants then separate the hydrocarbons by putting more O2 in the greater than or equal to O2 side. I accidentally put the saltwater outside of the salt. That was silly. This is our grey-water tank. Additionally, we're collecting water condensate and we no longer need the LEDs so the light-emitting diodes are not on the grow lights on the inside of the craft to heat the water condensate and blow it out with a piston to keep the gases inside. Remember, we're floating not sinking because we're in a gas.
