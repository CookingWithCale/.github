This is a Night cooking session for the Greentech Cookbook, an open-source book on how to build DIY greentech to stop global warming. The Session ticket can be found at 

https://github.com/oregon-cooler/greentech.cookbook/issues/54

, and you can find me on the web at

https://cookingwithcale.org.

Tonight I'm going to demonstrate how to grow 2 batches of food by taking advantage of the space above the cooler (i.e. modified mini-fridge) in the Oregon-Cooler Gas Extractor.
