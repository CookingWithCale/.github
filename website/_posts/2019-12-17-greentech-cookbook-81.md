This is a Night cooking session for the Greentech Cookbook, an open-source book on how to build DIY greentech to reverse global warming.

Last night I began designing the Aqua Roof.

Tonight I'm going to merge the Oregon-Cooler with the Grow room using one fridge per 12-hour room.

You can download and contribute to this cookbook and read more about what was accomplished in this session on the Session ticket at [https://github.com/oregon-cooler/greentech.cookbook/issues/81](https://github.com/oregon-cooler/greentech.cookbook/issues/81).
