This is a Night cooking session for the Greentech Cookbook, an open-source book on how to build DIY greentech to reverse global warming.

Last night I redesigned the Oregon-Cooler to use wall-mount metal containers to pump either hot or ice-cold water into to either heat or cool your home by blowing the hot-dry air from the Salt-log dehumidifier past the metal tank.

Tonight I revamped the Session log format to make updating the blog easier.

Tonight I'm going to create the Solid CAD model for the Aqua Heating and Air Conditioning (HAC) Vent I designed last night.

You can download and contribute to this cookbook and read more about what was accomplished in this session on the Session ticket at [https://github.com/oregon-cooler/greentech.cookbook/issues/81](https://github.com/oregon-cooler/greentech.cookbook/issues/81).
