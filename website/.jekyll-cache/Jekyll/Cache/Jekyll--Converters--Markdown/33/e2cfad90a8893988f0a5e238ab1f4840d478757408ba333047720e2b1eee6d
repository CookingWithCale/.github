<p>This is a Night cooking session for the Greentech Cookbook, an open-source book on how to build DIY greentech to reverse global warming.</p>

<p>Last night I drew the first mockup of the Aqua HAC Vent and redrew the Oregon-Cooler water routing.</p>

<p>Today I revamped the show schedule add one Cookbook per day.</p>

<p>Tonight I’m going to design the Aqua HAC Vent in FreeCAD 0.18.</p>

<p>You can download and contribute to this cookbook and read more about what was accomplished in this session on the Session ticket at <a href="https://github.com/oregon-cooler/greentech.cookbook/issues/81">https://github.com/oregon-cooler/greentech.cookbook/issues/81</a>.</p>
