<p>This is a Morning cooking session for the KabukiPress Cookbook, an Open-source book that teaches you Modern Embedded-C++, Script2, and IMUL with Kabuki Toolkit. Today Iâ€™m going to work on fixing the ASCII Book Contiguous data structure. An ASCII Book is an Associative List, which means itâ€™s like a Dictionary that can contain multiple keys. This is accomplished using an Array of Strings called an ASCII Loom.</p>

<p>If you could like to download, fork, star, or contribute to this cookbook on GitHub, the Session ticket can be found at <a href="https://github.com/kabuki-starship/kabuki.press.cookbook/issues/64">https://github.com/kabuki-starship/kabuki.press.cookbook/issues/64</a>.</p>
