<p>This is a Night cooking session for the Greentech Cookbook, an open-source book on how to build DIY greentech to reverse global warming.</p>

<p>Last night I began designing the Aqua Roof.</p>

<p>Tonight Iâ€™m going to merge the Oregon-Cooler with the Grow room using one fridge per 12-hour room.</p>

<p>You can download and contribute to this cookbook and read more about what was accomplished in this session on the Session ticket at <a href="https://github.com/oregon-cooler/greentech.cookbook/issues/81">https://github.com/oregon-cooler/greentech.cookbook/issues/81</a>.</p>
