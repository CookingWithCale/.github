<p>This is a Night cooking session for the Greentech Cookbook, an open-source book on how to build DIY greentech to reverse global warming.  Tonight, I teach you how to use various sensors to extract heat from cold water and heat it up with a fan, and separate the gases in the Cold smoke grow room into oxygen and free club soda by burning trash on your stove and percolating it through water condensate in your refrigerator.</p>

<p>!!! Danger Warning!!!</p>

<p>I accidentally told you to vent the extracted hydrocarbons into the grow tent. DO NOT DO THAT!!! YOU JUST MADE A BOMB!!!! You must compress the fuel into a tank and feed the CO2 to the plants or drink it.</p>
