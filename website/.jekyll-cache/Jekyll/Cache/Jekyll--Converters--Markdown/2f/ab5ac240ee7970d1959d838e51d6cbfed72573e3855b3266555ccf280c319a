<p>This is a Night cooking session for the Kabuki Starship Cookbook, an open-source book on how to make Interstellar starships and Androids. In this session, we’re going to work on the design for the Kabuki Starship Autopilot using the Law of Thermal Relativity in radial coordinates to perform Gravitational lassoing.</p>

<p>Results: I didn’t get as far as I wanted into the design, it was more of a recap due to lack of the Bridge, but I set the stage for the IGEEK (Interactive Gym Environment and Education Kit) environment and the FreeCAD model. Of course, we’re going to use a better app someday but FreeCAD is good for manual programmatic modeling.</p>
