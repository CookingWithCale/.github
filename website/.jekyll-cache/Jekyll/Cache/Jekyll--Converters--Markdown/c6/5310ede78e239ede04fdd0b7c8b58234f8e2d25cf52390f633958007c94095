<p>This is a Night cooking session for the Greentech Cookbook, an open-source book on how to build DIY greentech to reverse global warming.</p>

<p>Last night I redesigned the Oregon-Cooler to use wall-mount metal containers to pump either hot or ice-cold water into to either heat or cool your home by blowing the hot-dry air from the Salt-log dehumidifier past the metal tank.</p>

<p>Tonight I revamped the Session log format to make updating the blog easier.</p>

<p>Tonight Iâ€™m going to create the Solid CAD model for the Aqua Heating and Air Conditioning (HAC) Vent I designed last night.</p>

<p>You can download and contribute to this cookbook and read more about what was accomplished in this session on the Session ticket at <a href="https://github.com/oregon-cooler/greentech.cookbook/issues/81">https://github.com/oregon-cooler/greentech.cookbook/issues/81</a>.</p>
