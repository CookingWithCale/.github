<p>This is a Night cooking session for the Greentech Cookbook, an open-source book on how to build DIY greentech to reverse global warming.</p>

<p>Tonight Iâ€™m going to teach you how to minimize the thermal heat loss by rerouting your stove exhaust into a Cold Room using a water preheater on your roof to cool and condense the smoke from the waste fuel weâ€™re burning on the stove to boil water to take it down into the Oregon-Cooler.</p>

<p>You can download and contribute to this cookbook and read more about what was accomplished in this session on the Session ticket at <a href="https://github.com/oregon-cooler/greentech.cookbook/issues/81">https://github.com/oregon-cooler/greentech.cookbook/issues/81</a>.</p>
