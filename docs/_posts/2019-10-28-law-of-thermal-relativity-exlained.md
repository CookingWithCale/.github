In this live-stream, I will attempt disprove Netwon's theory that gravity exists using McCollough's Law of Thermal Relativity that proves there is a cloud of positively charged hydrogen atoms in the thermal equilibrium between two starts and that faster than light travel is possible because Force_xyz = Mass * Sigma (Mass_xyz * (Speed of Light)^2)), and I will explain why it's C^2 and how the light turns back into mass.

Correction: I incorrectly wrote Temperature=Sigma (M*C^2), it is (Sigma ((1/M_*C^2) / N) where N is the number of atoms, because potential energy is inversely proportional to mass. It is actually easier to use Polar coordinates, which we will cover in the upcoming Kabuki Autopilot Explained video. Additionally, I forgot to cover how 1/(MassOf((+)Hydrogen) is slightly less than 1, which is our maximum Temperature, so C^2 is obviously the scalar energy stored in the mass at our speed of light, but the (+)Hydrogen ions in the middle aren't moving in relation to the sun, it moves in relation to the other stars. You must also use the equation F_xyz = M * (M_xyz * C_xzy^2) because of the light-speed constant changes (@see Bose-Einstein condensate). C^2 is actually a measure of work done by the Electro and Magnetic components in low density; just replace the word light with energy and you get Energy/Year. Because of this, you must orient the Z-axis of every particle to the Thermal Gradient, AKA Gravity AKA a lower energy state.
