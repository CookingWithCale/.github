This is a Morning cooking session for the KabukiPress Cookbook, an Open-source book that teaches you Modern Embedded-C++, Script2, and IMUL with Kabuki Toolkit. Today I'm going to work on fixing the ASCII Book Contiguous data structure. An ASCII Book is an Associative List, which means it's like a Dictionary that can contain multiple keys. This is accomplished using an Array of Strings called an ASCII Loom.

If you could like to download, fork, star, or contribute to this cookbook on GitHub, the Session ticket can be found at [https://github.com/kabuki-starship/kabuki.press.cookbook/issues/64](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/kabuki.press.cookbook/issues/64).
