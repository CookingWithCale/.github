In this live-stream, I will explain Blackhole physics and gravity as a thermal gradient where the sun is trying to reach a thermal equilibrium because the heaviest element has all mass with a temperature of zero, and teach you how to build a digital photonic neural net using an AnyLED light controller, laser diodes, photosensors, and wireless power transmission to create light-forms in infinite simulations of the colonization of the Universe.

Minor Correction: The Digital photonic neurons are connected to a stiff fiber optic cable that keeps them in a lattice. It also is going to work better to just shine a light into the water to charge it via solar power.
