In this live-stream, we're going to continue working on the KabukiPress Cookbook and go down to the most very bottom of the Kabuki Starship into the Uniprinter and Puff Algorithm, the Fastest Method to Print Integers and Floating-point Numbers; which is an integer printing algorithm that is then used to optimize all other Floating-point printing algorithms. I will show you how to print Unicode in Modern Embedded-C++ without the hassle of the C++ Standard and STL libraries.
