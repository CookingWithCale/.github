This is a Night cooking session for the Greentech Cookbook, an open-source book on how to build DIY greentech to reverse global warming.

Last night I drew the first mockup of the Aqua HAC Vent and redrew the Oregon-Cooler water routing.

Today I revamped the show schedule add one Cookbook per day.

Tonight I'm going to design the Aqua HAC Vent in FreeCAD 0.18.

You can download and contribute to this cookbook and read more about what was accomplished in this session on the Session ticket at [https://github.com/oregon-cooler/greentech.cookbook/issues/81](https://github.com/oregon-cooler/greentech.cookbook/issues/81).
