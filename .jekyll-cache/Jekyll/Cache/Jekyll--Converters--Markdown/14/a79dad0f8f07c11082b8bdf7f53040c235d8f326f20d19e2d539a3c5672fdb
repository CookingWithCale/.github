<h2 id="bio">Bio</h2>

<p>Cale McCollough, the host of Cooking with Cale, is a 37-year-old software and computer engineer, and entrepreneur from Eugene, Oregon. Cooking with Cale is a hacker, maker, greentech, and entrepreneur live-stream that produces the publications and open-source cookbooks and software and hardware projects in the <a href="/projects">Projects page</a>.</p>

<p>The Astartup and I am You Language (IMUL) uses a powerful productivity technique called Morning, Day, and Night Sessions that starts out with a Morning Session and the Hour of Seconds from 9-10 AM WST, which is an hour per day dedicated to the Astartup Secondary Thread. That gets followed up by an off-camera Day session in the flow state until 4PM WST when I start preparing for another Hour of Seconds on-camera open-source Night Session from 5-6 PM WST.</p>

<p>Each Morning and Night Session before I go on camera, I write a pen-and-paper IMUL log to prepare for the show. After that I start the blog post and prepare it to refine the show Mission and Vision. I then get the GitHub issue tickets ready to keep track of time and so I can start running out of the gate. When I start streaming I do a review of the prior session, followed by a Mission briefing, and a an Hour of Seconds where I put on a count-down timer and work for one hour on the Secondary Thread. The Night Session is identical to the Morning Session in format. Before the Day session and before I go to bed, I finish any issues that I could not complete on camera so the ball keeps moving; this is called the Astartup productivity system.</p>
