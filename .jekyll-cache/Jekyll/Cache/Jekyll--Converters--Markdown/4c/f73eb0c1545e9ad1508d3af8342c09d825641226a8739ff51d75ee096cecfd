<p>This is a Night cooking session for the Greentech Cookbook, an open-source book on how to build DIY greentech to stop global warming. The Session ticket can be found at https://github.com/oregon-cooler/greentech.cookbook/issues/52, and you can find me on the web at https://cookingwithcale.org. Tonight Iâ€™m going to demonstrate an improved cold-water CO2 and hydrocarbon gas extraction technique that allows us to reuse the water condensate.</p>

<p>The Green-energy revolution is funded by open-source contributions from people like you.  If you would like to contribute to the book, please fork and star us on GitHub using the Session ticket link above. If you want to help improve Cooking with Cale by funding staff to do stuff like write scripts, make animations, edit cookbooks, advertize, and do AI research, you can become a Patreon at patreon.com/astartup.</p>
