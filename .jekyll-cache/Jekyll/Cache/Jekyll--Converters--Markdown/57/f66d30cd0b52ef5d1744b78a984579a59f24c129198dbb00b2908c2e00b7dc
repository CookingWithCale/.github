I"<p>Cale McCollough, the host of Cooking with Cale, is a 37-year-old software and computer engineer, and entrepreneur from Eugene, Oregon. Cooking with Cale is a hacker, maker, greentech, and entrepreneur live-stream that produces the publications and open-source cookbooks and software and hardware projects below. The Astartup and I am You Language (IMUL) uses a powerful productivity technique called Morning, Day, and Night Sessions that starts out with a Morning Session and the Hour of Seconds from 9-10 AM WST, which is an hour per day dedicated to the Astartup Secondary Thread. That gets followed up by an off-camera Day session in the flow state until 4PM WST when I start preparing for another 1-2 hour on-camera open-source Night Session from 5-6 PM WST.</p>

<p>Each section of the Cookbooks listed below will have one short and more interesting video per section where I recap what I did in the Live-stream sessions and I am hoping to raise funds to pay for people to add profession video effects, animations, and audio. In addition to the free content, your donations sponsor hiring additional content creators to make you private videos pertaining to the Cookbooks that you get to vote on what the videos are about, and we hire professional consultants who specialize in that specific field, so your donations get high millage.</p>
