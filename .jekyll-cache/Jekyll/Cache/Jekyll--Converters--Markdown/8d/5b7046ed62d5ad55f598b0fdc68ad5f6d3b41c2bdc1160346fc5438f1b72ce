<p>This live-stream is a cooking session for the Greentech Cookbook, an open-source book on how to build DIY tech and Oregon-Coolers to stop global warming. In this session, weâ€™re going to change the design of the Oregon-Cooler to work with a wider variety of homes by creating a Window Garden and Light Pole models, create a template to cut the wood, and begin routing the wood with a hand router and a drill press.</p>
