Democrats are far-right. Far-right means authoritarian top-down steep social hierarchy controlled by a small ingroup, elites and oligarchs. Fascism is where the State (i.e. "the people") owns the "means of production" (i.e. the economy). Socialism means social ownership of the economy.

They shared a common vision to reshape society.

Democrats are top-down leadership. Most Democrats get their political ideology from celebrities. Hollywood now makes more than double the money in China than in the US.

Where do fascist leaders live? In big cities. Where do most Democrats live? Big cities. Democrats are socialists and fascists are socialists. Do you really think Nazis came from rural areas? The top of the social hierarchy is in the country. I have a bridge to sell you.  

Fascists by definition control the corporations in the big cities and they push for socialism. Who controls the corporations? Democrats do. People think it's Republicans, but that isn't true. The administration is obsessed with branding in almost every industry, and almost every industry's administration has gone #woke. Admin are in a different class of people, they aren't in our society, they fire us to replace with younger more diverse people and the best and brightest. Corporations can't have anyone associate them with anything negative, so they hire professionals to brainwash the public.
