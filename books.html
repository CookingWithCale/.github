* Greentech Cookbook - An open-source book on how to build DIY hardware and IoT software to combat global warming and save money on bills. This is a new book that will get getting fleshed out in the Live-stream.
Astartup Cookbook - An open-source book about how to invent, start, and launch a high-tech startup with I am You Language. This book has a moderate amount of work on it but it's a pre-alpha version with no working IMUL compiler ATM. I've also got a free-to-use closed-source all at astartup.net where the Live-stream "blog" hosted.
* KabukiPress Cookbook - An open-source book on how to make connected services, apps, websites, and books with Modern Embedded-C++, Script2, and I am You Language (IMUL). This book has very little work done on it but the format is and some of the flow is fleshed out.
* Kabuki Starship Cookbook - An open-source on how to build starships and androids.
* SCRIPT Specification - The Serial Chinese Room, Interprocess, and Telemetry (SCRIPT) Specification define the ASCII Data Specification, the Chinese Room Abstract Stack Machine (Crabs), as well as some experimental features.
* The Fastest Methods wiki - Our founder, Cale McCollough, is the author of the Fastest Method to Print Integers and Floating-point Numbers, Fastest Method to Align Pointers, and other articles in the Script2 wiki.
